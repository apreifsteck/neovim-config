# neovim-config
Ripped this from Robert Yost (many thanks)

Some of the packages I have installed require installing some external python or node packages. I haven't added them here (because I forgot what they are).
I'd welcome a PR to add them in to this readme though!

# Installation
 - clone this repo into your ~/.config directory and call it `nvim`

# TODO
- figure out how to get better results out of the frecency searcher
- add a debounce to auto saving
- maybe switch to a different session manager?
- maybe switch to a different package manager (lazy)
- add an IO inspect snippet
